vocab_tester imports a file of vocab words and helps you learn them.
It incorporates a queue to store words that you want to go back to later.

This is a practical idea that (1) gives more practice for the craftsmanship movement as detailed
in The RSpec Book and (2) results in a useful application.

TODO:
-add scenario to start test: start test without word file
